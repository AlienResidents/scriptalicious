Various misc scripts I use

* '''bin/hostess'''
For a non-shared home directory in multiple environments.  Eventually it'll use a mysqld backend to keep track of hosts it has been ran against.  It should also be able to run scheduled updates from cron or similar.

* '''perlDaemon.pl'''
This is a very simple basic perl daemon for testing daemon'ness (yes, I'm sure that's a word somewhere).
